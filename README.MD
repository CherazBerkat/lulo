## 📱 On Your Phone

1. **Download the folder** (the one I’ll share on Drive).
   Save or unzip it somewhere you can access easily.

2. **Install an app called “sHTTP”** from the Play Store.
   It’s a small local-server app that lets you open files directly from your phone.

3. **Open sHTTP**, and:

   - Grant it the storage permission it asks for.
   - Tap “Choose Directory” and select the folder where you saved _Only Us_.
   - It will show you a local link like

     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html
     ```

     (your number might differ a bit).

4. **Copy that link** and open it in Chrome, Samsung Internet, or any browser.
   The app should open right away .

5. Once it’s open, you can **add it to your home screen** (via browser menu → “Add to Home Screen”) to keep it like a little app.

## 💻 On Your Laptop or PC

1. **Download the same folder** (from the Drive link).
2. Locate the file called **`index.html`** inside it.
3. **Right-click → Open With → Microsoft Edge** (or Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

   - If Chrome refuses to show animations, try Edge or Firefox instead.

4. If it still doesn’t run properly, open the sub-folders and try their own `index.html` files —
   some of them may load the individual animations separately.

- **Tap** or **click** on the glowing orb or screen to see what happens.
- Some things react only after a few seconds, or when you stay still.

### 🕯️ Note

No installation, no accounts, no tracking.
It’s all self-contained — just light, color, and words meant for you.
If something doesn’t load the first time, just refresh or reopen it through sHTTP.
